## Installation
We provide a simple installation script that, by default, sets up a conda environment with Python 3.9, PyTorch 1.13, and CUDA 11.6.

```.bash
# This Script Assumes Python 3.9, CUDA 11.6

conda deactivate

# Set environment variables
export ENV_NAME=posediffusion

# Create a new conda environment and activate it
conda create -n $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VERSION
conda activate $ENV_NAME

# Install PyTorch, torchvision, and PyTorch3D using pip and prebuilt wheel
python -m pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
python -m pip install /home/openark/Desktop/PoseDiffusion/pose_diffusion/pytorch3d-0.7.2-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl

# Install pip packages
python -m pip install hydra-core --upgrade
python -m pip install omegaconf opencv-python einops visdom 
python -m pip install accelerate==0.24.0

# Install HLoc for extracting 2D matches (optional if GGS is not needed)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization.git dependency/hloc

cd dependency/hloc
python -m pip install -e .
cd ../../

# Ensure the version of pycolmap is not 0.5.0
python -m pip install --upgrade "pycolmap>=0.3.0,<=0.4.0"
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Checkpoint

Download the model checkpoint trained on Co3D from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqzrv9i0umdv17d/co3d_model_Apr16.pth?dl=0). The predicted camera poses and focal lengths are defined in [NDC coordinate](https://pytorch3d.org/docs/cameras).


### 2. Run the Demo

```.bash
python demo.py image_folder="samples/apple" ckpt="/PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/CKPT"
```

You can experiment with your own data by specifying a different `image_folder`.


On a Quadro GP100 GPU, the inference time for a 20-frame sequence is approximately 0.8 seconds without GGS and around 80 seconds with GGS (including 20 seconds for matching extraction).

You can choose to enable or disable GGS (or other settings) in `./cfgs/default.yaml`.

We use [Visdom](https://github.com/fossasia/visdom) by default for visualization. Ensure your Visdom settings are correctly configured to visualize the results accurately. However, Visdom is not necessary for running the model.

## Training

### 1. Preprocess Annotations

Start by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/amyxlase/relpose-plus-plus#pre-processing-co3d) to preprocess the annotations of the Co3D V2 dataset. This will significantly reduce data processing time during training.

### 2. Specify Paths

Next, specify the paths for `CO3D_DIR` and `CO3D_ANNOTATION_DIR` in `./cfgs/default_train.yaml`. `CO3D_DIR` should be set to the path where your downloaded Co3D dataset is located, while `CO3D_ANNOTATION_DIR` should point to the location of the annotation files generated after completing the preprocessing in step 1.

### 3. Start Training

- For 1-GPU Training:
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```

- For multi-GPU training, launch the training script using [accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/basic_tutorials/launch), e.g., training on 8 GPUs (processes) in 1 node (machines):
  ```bash
  accelerate launch --num_processes=8 --multi_gpu --num_machines=1 train.py 
  ```
  
All configurations are specified inside `./cfgs/default_train.yaml`. Please notice that we use Visdom to record logs.

## Testing

### 1. Specify Paths

Please specify the paths `CO3D_DIR`, `CO3D_ANNOTATION_DIR`, and `resume_ckpt` in `./cfgs/default_test.yaml`. The flag `resume_ckpt` refers to your downloaded model checkpoint.

### 2. Run Testing

```bash
python test.py
```

You can check different testing settings by adjusting `num_frames`, `GGS.enable`, and others in `./cfgs/default_test.yaml`.
